## Introduction
Come Shave With Me is a project by Alexandra Barancová & Jae Perris in
collaboration with Moniker.

The project proposes an outlet for social grooming in a time of distancing; Come Shave With
Me is a virtual skin that people can groom together, online.

Sheared silky smooth, maintained mildly prickly or kept rough and bushy… There are countless
ways you might like it. You won’t know until you try.

With public events and gatherings cut down around the world, bodily self-care is – let’s be
honest – not necessarily a top-most priority. Your arms, armpits, chest, back, genitals, or
legs are (usually) tucked away during video chats and conferences after all. What part of it
is just for others’ eyes to see and skins to feel? What do we make of our physical bodies in
isolation?

The virtual world often has neither the patience, nor the infrastructure to accommodate the
wants and needs of our bodies. Come Shave With Me speculates whether the satisfactions
enjoyed from bodily grooming could be recreated and shared in virtual spaces.

This work is an outcome of Figureable, an artistic research project funded by the Creative
Industries Fund NL. Figureable explores our relationships to and with our bodies through
embodiment in games.
